Self-introduction
======
I am presently a postgraduate students at Key Laboratory of Computer Network and Information Integration Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, supervised by Prof. [Xiaoping Li](https://www.scholat.com/xpli) and associate supervised by Dr. [Shuang Wang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/2022/0218/c23024a399055/page.htm). My research focuses on hybrid deployment problem for microservices and machine learning tasks in clusters an issue commonly referred to as **'colocation'**. To solve the problem, I study on the following methods, including but not limited to distributed algorithms, time-series prediction, reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks. Before this, I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Management at the College of Architecture Science and Engineering at Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.
