With the advanced development of Metaverse, various service requests are required to be processed as soon as possible which contains a series of tasks with topology structure (workflow) and different privacy constraints. Due to the diversity and complex hierarchical structure of resources, how to rent suitable resources from cloud, edge, and local nodes to minimize the makespan of workflows is currently one of the key issues in service computing scenarios. Due to the limited computing resources of local devices, tasks need to be offloaded to edge or cloud servers. Based on task privacy constraints, it is challenging to determine the appropriate offloading nodes for each task in the workflow. In this paper, for workflows with multi-privacy level tasks, a privacy-preserving workflow scheduling algorithm based on clustering (PWCSA) is proposed to minimize the workflow makespan with limited bandwidth. Multiple tasks of different privacy levels are clustered into one task pipeline to reduce the data transmission time caused by limited bandwidth, thereby reducing workflow makespan. After statistically calibrating algorithm parameters over a comprehensive set of workflow instances, the proposed algorithms are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms over five workflow-type instances. The results indicate that the proposed PWCSA algorithm outperforms other algorithms with acceptable computational time. Through a number of workflow instances, the system parameters are verified by analysis of variance methods.
